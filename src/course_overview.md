## General Schedule

Each lab will have 3 weeks of allotted time. A strategy for how to use this time:

-   Before week 1: Study background of the experiment. 
    -   Study lab manual. Prepare procedure, anticipated analysis, read up on equipment usage. 
    -   Write background notes on the physics
    -   Write the introduction and objective sections for the lab
-   Week 1: Get comfortable with lab setup. 
    -   Work through components of the procedure. 
    -   Estimate time needed for each step. 
    -   Get preliminary data to set up analysis software.
-   Before week 2: Perform preliminary analysis. 
    -   Analyze results to determine steps that will need to be redone. 
    -   Determine holes in understanding. 
-   Week 2: Do experiment from start to finish. 
    -   Try to be as detailed as possible. 
    -   Record what sections need to be redone. 
-   Before week 3: Complete analysis. 
    -   Assemble draft of the presentation. 
    -   Determine what data needs to be recollected. 
-   Week 3: Wrap up. 
    -   Go to lab prepared to discuss draft with instructor or TA. 
    -   Repeat experiments identified. 
    -   Complete presentation.
