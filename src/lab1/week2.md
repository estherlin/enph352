# Week 2 Data Collection



## Procedure

### Centering

Use default parameters to set center burst to 1024. Also need to check if baseline is at 0. Spectrums are really noisy. Realized that IR source was off. Done with the cell in place, 

-   only graph was saved. 
-   Remember, positive sign to move burst to left
-   3

### Step 7

Absorption of air. Acquire a signal at 4cm^-1^ resolution. Worked with Arthur to purge the cell with air. Collect data with Arthur. Tried one acquisition, also wanted to see the forwards and backwards motion. so did it with 32. 

| Num Acquisitions | Timestamp | Filename                         |      |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- | ---- |
| 1                |           | ```air_cell_4cm-1.txt```         |      |
| 32               |           | ```air_cell_4cm-1(32 acq).txt``` |      |

### Step 5

Flush with N2. Flow rate on this is pretty pathetic. Should flush for 20 mins. Flushing rate at max 60. Having arduino problems. On the bright side, we have been flushing since 2:45. Got data. 



Take a look at Arthur's bad data. 



### Step 6

Start CO2 3:16. At 60. After one minute, take 32 acquisitions.
